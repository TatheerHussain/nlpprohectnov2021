> The idea is to create a new hate speech detection in roman URDU language, that could out perform current systems out there.

# Steps to Follow 
1. Corpus Building 
    - There are presently no corpuses that could meet this studies requirements, thatâ€™s why starting from the begining could be a plus
2. Target Selection 
    - There is need to find the target of our corpus data, like ethnicity, religious, racism, nationality, casteism,  national Security. Although there are many such categories that can be selected as a domain like previous studies have done but I will choose few of them. 

    - The idea is to identify the hate/offensive speech in Roman Urdu social media posts against ethnicity, racism, religion, ethnic groups etc.
3. Labelling
    - Labelling the data based on offensive, hate, racism or not.
4. Data collection
    - Selected Keywords from Twitter and Facebook
        - Relevent Tweets/posts 
        - removing unnecessary data like urls,hashtags etc
        - Refining the data

### Proposed Methodology 

1. Training the Data
2. Preprocessing
3. Tf-Idf
    - Algorithms (yet to decide)
        - Traning Labels 
        - Baseline model
            - Test data 
            - Label Predictions 
                - Result validations 
                    - Test lables 
                    - Final results
