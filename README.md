# steps to follow 
1. Corpus Building 
    There are presently no corpuses that could meet this studies requirements, thatâ€™s why starting from the begining could be a plus
2. Target Selection 
    2.1 There is need to find the target of our corpus data, like ethnicity, religious, racism, nationality, casteism,  national Security. Although there are many such categories that can be selected as a domain like previous studies have done but I will choose few of them. 

    The idea is to identify the hate/offensive speech in Roman Urdu social media posts against ethnicity, racism, religion, ethnic groups etc.
3. Labelling
    Labelling the data based on offensive, hate, racism or not.
4. Data collection
    Selected Keywords from Twitter and Facebook
        Relevent Tweets/posts 
        removing urls/emoticons/hashtags etc
        Refining the data
